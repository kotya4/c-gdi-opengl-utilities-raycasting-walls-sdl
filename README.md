ttlcheck
ttl checker with fancy icon (now 150% fancier)
May 31, 2021 15:50
Checks ttl value in Windows. If you change ttl via regedit make sure to reboot before check. Size of program grows to 150%. If initial value of fancy was n, then after n operated with fancyness of icon itself it becomes 1.5n, then, if fancyness of icon is m, F(n,m) = 1.5*n, n and m are in same set A, F:A,A->A if A is at least R^1, or F:A,A->R^1,A,<1,*>.

What happens when you want to mimic raycasting with naive trigonometry? Becomes, drawing frame by frame by hand is more pleasurable than programming an animation of rotation in 2.5d space
