========================================================

THIS PROJECT IS SO DIRTY I CANT TAKE IT ANYMORE,
SEE " ray " FOR SUCCESSOR OF THIS PROJECT.

========================================================

Pseudo 3d game engine by me ( sluchaynayakotya )
targeting platform: windows xp, intel pentium III, sis mirrage ( 640x480 ~20fps )
server graphics: sdl2 ( and maybe pure gdi if i am not lazy )
client graphics: raycasting\dda, 32bit depthbuffer, valued alpha, mode7 surfaces (osmth)

map is randomly generated using recoursive division algorithm.
sprites are indexated, colors are transformed into rgb332.
no need for huffman algorithm because of compression rate:
~2% for indexed bitmaps, not a big deal. btw ~95% on raw bmp, impressive huh?


Some Code Conventions:

Function named <STRUCT>_init[_<TYPE>] must free allocated memory on error.
Other functions can preserve allocated memory for debugging.

free ( ... ) can be called without checking wether pointer is pointing to allocated memory.
Althrough after deallocation pointer has to be set to NULL.

Any function returning status must return negative value on error and zero or positive on success.

Namespaces partially fucked up tho so do not mind.
