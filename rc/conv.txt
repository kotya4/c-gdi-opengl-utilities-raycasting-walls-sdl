Conventions:

Function named <STRUCT>_init[_<TYPE>] must free allocated memory on error.
Other functions can preserve allocated memory for debugging.

free ( ... ) can be called without checking wether pointer is pointing to allocated memory.
Althrough after deallocation pointer has to be set to NULL.
